This software uses automated tests to combat unknown regressions.

Non-Testing
Lets not test functions for their individual arguments to be correct.

Unit Testing
Small pieces or sections of application logic, tested in isolate of each other. Usually achived by importing classes and testing methods directly and verifying that they interact correctly.

System Testing
Running an application entrypoint, and running tests against it. Usually achived by running an entrypoint, and then launching a program that can interact with it.

Service Testing
Running all application entrypoints, and running tests against the whole service.
